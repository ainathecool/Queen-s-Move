# Queen-s-Move
An interactive puzzle developed in C++ based on the popular N-Queens problem. 

The Queen’s Move puzzle deals with the problem of placing N chess queens on an N x N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. The intended behavior of the resultant software is such that the user plays and succeeds in a manner that no two queens are in the same row, the same column, or along the same diagonal. These are the functional requirements of the software, maintaining the system logic and architecture requirements.

Queen’s Move is a digital game, specifically made for chess buffs. However, it entertains a ‘How to Play’ section, which explains the techniques and methods for the game, also providing the user with hints and suggestions. This makes it conveniently available to access and document for usage of chess enthusiasts. It also provides data security, along with user authentication to make the user’s experience more reliable and safer for their usability.

This scope of this project includes a game design. This game Queen’s Move will be consisting of instructions for the beginner players. There will be multiple levels in the game. Level will get more complex once the player levels up.
